# SmaCalculator ðŸ“ˆ  
A **Java program** that reads stock market data from a CSV file, calculates the **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** for key price metrics, and writes the results to a new CSV file.

---

##  Features  
âœ… Reads stock market data from a CSV file  
âœ… Filters out invalid or incomplete rows  
âœ… Computes **SMA (10-day moving average)** for:  
   - Open Price  
   - High Price  
   - Low Price  
   - Close Price  
   - Adjusted Close Price  
   - Volume (rounded to the nearest whole number)  
âœ… Writes the updated data with SMA values into a new CSV file  
âœ… Efficient **sliding window** implementation for SMA calculation

##  How It Works  
1. **Reads CSV file** (`RELIANCE_DATA.csv`)  
2. **Validates and cleans data** (removes rows with missing values)  
3. **Calculates SMA** (10-day moving average) for multiple stock metrics  
4. **Writes the results** to a new CSV file (`RELIANCE_SMA.csv`)
